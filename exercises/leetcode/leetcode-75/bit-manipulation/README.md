# Bit Manipulation

Bit Manipulation is a technique used to perform operations at the bit-level. It is used to manipulate individual bits of a number. It is a fast and efficient way to perform operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Use Cases

Bit Manipulation is used in a variety of problems, including:

-  The Single Number problem
-  The Single Number II problem
-  The Single Number III problem
-  The Missing Number problem
-  The Find the Difference problem
-  The Counting Bits problem
-  The Number of 1 Bits problem
-  The Reverse Bits problem
-  The Power of Two problem
-  The Bitwise AND of Numbers Range problem
-  The Bitwise OR of Numbers Range problem

## Common operations

-  Bitwise AND
-  Bitwise OR
-  Bitwise XOR
-  Bitwise NOT
-  Bitwise Left Shift
-  Bitwise Right Shift
-  Bitwise Rotate Left
-  Bitwise Rotate Right
