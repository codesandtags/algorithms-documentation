# Arrays

Arrays are a fundamental data structure in computer science. They are used to store a collection of elements, each identified by at least one array index or key. The elements of an array are stored in contiguous memory locations. The key difference between an array and a list is that the array is a fixed-size data structure, while a list is a dynamic data structure.

## Edge cases

-  Empty array
-  Array with one element
-  Array with two elements
-  Array with all elements the same
-  Array with all elements different
-  Array with negative numbers
-  Array with positive numbers
-  Array with both negative and positive numbers
-

## Use Cases

Arrays are used in a variety of problems, including:

-  The Two Sum problem
-  The Three Sum problem
-  The Four Sum problem
-  The Maximum Subarray problem
-  The Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock problem
-  The Contains Duplicate problem
-  The Product of Array Except Self problem
-  The Maximum Product Subarray problem
-  The Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array problem
-  The Search in Rotated Sorted Array problem

## Common operations

-  Accessing an element by index
-  Updating an element by index
-  Inserting an element at the beginning
-  Inserting an element at the end
-  Inserting an element at a specific index
-  Deleting an element at the beginning
-  Deleting an element at the end
-  Deleting an element at a specific index

## Time complexity

-  Accessing an element by index: O(1)
-  Updating an element by index: O(1)
-  Inserting an element at the beginning: O(n)
-  Inserting an element at the end: O(1)
-  Inserting an element at a specific index: O(n)
-  Deleting an element at the beginning: O(n)
-  Deleting an element at the end: O(1)
-  Deleting an element at a specific index: O(n)
-  Searching for an element: O(n)
-  Sorting an array: O(n log n)
-  Reversing an array: O(n)
-  Merging two arrays: O(n)
-  Copying an array: O(n)
-  Removing duplicates from an array: O(n)
-  Finding the maximum element in an array: O(n)
