# Two Pointers

Two pointers is a technique that involves creating two pointers to traverse a data structure, such as an array or a linked list. The pointers can move in the same direction or in opposite directions. The technique is often used to solve problems that involve searching for a pair of elements that satisfy a certain condition, such as the Two Sum problem.

## Use Cases

Two pointers is used in a variety of problems, including:

-  The Two Sum problem
-  The Three Sum problem
-  The Four Sum problem
-  The Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array problem
-  The Remove Element problem
-  The Move Zeroes problem
-  The Reverse String problem
-  The Valid Palindrome problem
-  The Container With Most Water problem
-  The Trapping Rain Water problem
-  The Linked List Cycle problem
-  The Linked List Cycle II problem
-

## Common operations

-  Moving two pointers in the same direction
-  Moving two pointers in opposite directions
-  Moving one pointer while keeping the other pointer fixed
-  Moving one pointer based on the value of the other pointer
-  Moving one pointer based on a condition
-  Moving one pointer based on the value of the element at the other pointer
-  Moving one pointer based on the value of the element at the other pointer and a condition
-  Moving one pointer based on the value of the element at the other pointer and a condition involving both pointers
-  Moving one pointer based on the value of the element at the other pointer and a condition involving both pointers and the data structure being traversed

## Time complexity

-  Moving two pointers in the same direction: O(n)
-  Moving two pointers in opposite directions: O(n)
-  Moving one pointer while keeping the other pointer fixed: O(n)
-  Moving one pointer based on the value of the other pointer: O(n)
-  Moving one pointer based on a condition: O(n)
-  Moving one pointer based on the value of the element at the other pointer: O(n)
-  Moving one pointer based on the value of the element at the other pointer and a condition: O(n)
-  Moving one pointer based on the value of the element at the other pointer and a condition involving both pointers: O(n)
-  Moving one pointer based on the value of the element at the other pointer and a condition involving both pointers and the data structure being traversed: O(n)

## Space complexity

The space complexity of the two pointers technique is O(1), as it only uses a constant amount of extra space.
