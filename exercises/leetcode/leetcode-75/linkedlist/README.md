# Linkedlist

Linkedlist is a data structure that consists of a sequence of elements where each element points to the next element in the sequence. It is a linear data structure that is used to store elements. It is used to store elements in a non-contiguous memory location. Each element in the linked list is called a node. Each node has two parts: data and a reference to the next node. The first node is called the head and the last node is called the tail. The tail node points to null.

## Use Cases

Linkedlist is used in a variety of problems, including:

-  [The Reverse Linked List problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/)
-  The Remove Nth Node From End of List problem
-  The Merge Two Sorted Lists problem
-  The Add Two Numbers problem
-  The Odd Even Linked List problem
-  The Palindrome Linked List problem
-  The Intersection of Two Linked Lists problem
-  The Linked List Cycle problem
