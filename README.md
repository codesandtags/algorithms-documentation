## Complexity Algorithms

| Complexity   | Notation | Description           | 
| ------------- |:-------------:| -------------:| 
| Constant Time | 1 | No matter how many elements we're working with, the algorithm/operation/whatever will always take the same amount of time | 
| Logarithmic Time | log(n) | You have this if doubling the number of elements you are iterating over doesn't double the amount of work. Always assume that searching operations are log(n) | 
| Linear Time | n | Iterating through all elements in a collecion of data. If you see a foor loop spanning from 0 to array.length, you probably have 'n' or linear runtime |
| Quasilinear Time | n * log(n) | You have this if doubling the number of elements you are iterating over doesnt's the amount of work. Always assume that any sorting operation is n * log(n) |
| Quadratic Time | 2 ^ n | Every element in a collection has to be compared to every other element. The 'handshake problem' |
| Exponential Time | n ^ 2 | If you add a 'single' element to a collection, the processing power requires doubles |

## Useful things
* Because I love the time and time is gold, that's why I've decided to use Intellij as my favorite IDE. Here I will put some useful links in order to optimize the time coding.
